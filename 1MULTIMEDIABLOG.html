        <strong>Salaar: Part 1</strong> – Ceasefire
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a <em>2023</em> Indian
        Telugu-language epic neo-noir action thriller film directed by Prashanth
        Neel and produced by Vijay Kiragandur under Hombale Films. The film
        stars Prabhas in the titular role, alongside an ensemble cast of
        Prithviraj Sukumaran, Shruti Haasan, Jagapathi Babu, Bobby Simha, Sriya
        Reddy, Ramachandra Raju, John Vijay, Easwari Rao, Tinnu Anand, Devaraj,
        Brahmaji and Mime Gopi. In the fictional dystopian city-state of
        Khansaar, where monarchy still exists, the film follows the friendship
        between Deva (Prabhas), the exiled prince of Khansaar, and Varadha
        (Prithviraj Sukumaran), the current prince of Khansaar. When a coup
        d'état is planned by his father's ministers and his relatives, Varadha
        enlists Deva's help to become Khansaar's undisputed ruler. The film's
        initial storyline was pitched from Neel's debut film Ugramm (2014) and
        is the maiden part of a two-part film.[3] It was officially announced in
        December 2020 under the title Salaar, however, in July 2023, its first
        instalment was titled as Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire. Principal
        photography commenced in January 2021, and occurred sporadically in
        several legs over nearly three years, before wrapping in late 2023.
        Filming locations included Telangana, Italy and Budapest. Production
        difficulties, ranging from the pandemic, reshoots and VFX delays,
        postponed Salaar's release date several times. The music is composed by
        Ravi Basrur, cinematography handled by Bhuvan Gowda and editing by Ujwal
        Kulkarni.
